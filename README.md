### Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rafay Khan and I'm a rising third-year studying Computer Science (BSE) at Princeton University. I like to automate things and develop software in the hopes of improving general quality of life.

I have experience with software development, machine learning, data science, and finance.

- Creator of Marshmallow, an automation project responsible for putting ~600 (3 Semesters) First-Gen, Low-Income Princeton students in touch with their mentors.
