### Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rafay Khan and I'm a second-year studying Computer Science (BSE) at Princeton University. I like to automate things and develop software in the hopes of improving general quality of life.

I have experience with data science, machine learning, finance, and software development. I'm looking to pursue either software and/or machine learning engineering as fields.
